# Homer Command Line Interface

A CLI for creating branches and tagging.

If **Herodotus** (often considered the "Father of History") is to **Python** (a programming language known for its readability and storytelling-like structure), then a comparable figure for **JavaScript** would be **Homer** (the ancient Greek poet famous for epic tales like The Iliad and The Odyssey).

## Why?

**Herodotus & Python:** Herodotus was a historian who emphasized storytelling, much like how Python is designed to be readable and structured in a way that emphasizes clarity.

**Homer & JavaScript:**
Homer’s works were dynamic, widely influential, and foundational to Western literature—just as JavaScript is to web development. JavaScript is also more dynamic and flexible, much like how Homer’s oral traditions evolved with time.
